### ```MazeGenerator.java```

Generates a maze image based on user defined parameters<br>
Output files generated are ```maze.bmp``` and ```maze.txt```<br>
```maze.bmp``` - an image file containing the maze<br>
```maze.txt``` - contains coordinates of origin and destination points

### ```MazeSolver.java```

Takes a maze image as input and produces another maze image with shortest path solution traced<br>
Input files required ```maze.bmp``` and ```maze.txt```<br>
```maze.bmp``` - an image file containing the maze<br>
```maze.txt``` - contains coordinates of origin and destination points<br>
Output file produces is ```mazesolnmod.bmp```<br>
```mazesolnmod.bmp``` - an image similar to ```maze.bmp``` with the shortest path traced from origin to destination traced
